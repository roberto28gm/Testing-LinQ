# Testing-LinQ
Windows Forms project for testing different LinQ methods and queries.

The solution has two different projects:
- Testing-LinQ: console based application with some static data.
- Forms-LinQ: Windows Forms application to manage and see a player/score database (in Json file). This application can sort by name and score and create new players directly to the Json file.
